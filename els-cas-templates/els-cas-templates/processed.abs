Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe developmental disorder that significantly impairs social abilities. Previous research has demonstrated impairments in functional brain connections in ASD patients. However,  existing research primarily relies on static functional connectivity and overlook critical information regarding temporal fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for diagnosing ASD based on a deep neural network and self-attention mechanism. Specifically, patient's dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) data were collected using sliding windows, and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to extract the features. \textcolor{red}{By stacking multi-head self-attention layers and combining with feedforward neural networks, the proposed model can effectively extract higher-order features in spatial terms and stitch them together in temporal dimensions,while correlations across different temporal windows are also captured. We conducted extensive experiments on the ABIDE dataset to validate the performance of our model. Using ten-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 76.22\% and an AUC of 0.8132, while using inter-site cross-validation, the model achieved an average accuracy of76.71\% and an AUC of 0.7955, which outperformed similar studies in diagnosing ASD. Furthermore, we identified that the superior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus are among the regions most affected in ASD, highlighting their importance for diagnosis and potential targets for intervention.Our model provides an effective approach for assisting in the diagnosis of ASD.}
