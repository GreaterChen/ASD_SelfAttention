Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe developmental disorder that significantly impairs social abilities. Previous research has demonstrated impairments in functional brain connections in ASD patients. However,  existing research primarily relies on static functional connectivity and overlook critical  information regarding temporal fluctuations. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for diagnosing ASD based on a deep neural network and self-attention mechanism. Specifically, patient's dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) data were collected using sliding windows, and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to extract the features. By stacking multi-head self-attention layers and combining them with feedforward neural networks, the proposed model effectively captures correlations between different windows and extracts spatially higher-order features. Ten-fold cross-validation on the ABIDE database demonstrated thar the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 76.22\% and an AUC of 0.8132. Furthermore, we ranked the functional connections with the highest likelihood of causing ASD based on Kendall's feature ranking. The results showed that the superior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus are among the regions most affected in ASD, highlighting their importance for diagnosis and potential targets for intervention.
