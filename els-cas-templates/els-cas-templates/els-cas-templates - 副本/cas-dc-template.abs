Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe developmental illness that can severely impair the social abilities of those affected. Previous research has demonstrated impairments in functional brain connection in ASD patients. This paper proposes a strategy for categorizing ASD based on the self-attention mechanism. Patients' dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) data were collected using sliding windows, and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to extract the features. A structure based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism is utilized to identify ASD using selected highly discriminative features. Then, using ten-fold cross-validation and inter-site cross-validation on the ABIDE database, we evaluated the model's performance and compared it to other published approaches. In ten-fold cross-validation, this model achieved an average accuracy of 76.22\% and an AUC of 0.8132, while in site cross-validation, it achieved an average accuracy of 76.71\% and an AUC of 0.7957. In addition, the 30 functional connections most likely to lead to ASD are shown based on the results of the feature ranking and the results showed that the superior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus have the greatest impact.
